Prerequisites:
	
	1.	Create a directory. Then open it.
	2.	Copy the directory's address.
		a. Should begin with a character with a colon, for example:
			- 'C:\'
			- 'H:\'
	3.	Put the 2 excel files within the directory (and only 2).
		a.	The reason for this is, based on the new hires for July/August 2016,
			2 excel files were provided, one with general information (first name, last name
			university, etc.) while the other contained each person's response to questions 
			(favorite film, interests, and 3 people they would invite to a dinner).

			- No other files should be within this directory.
	4.	Within the directory you created, create a directory with the name 'Photos', and place
		all the photos for the new hires within this folder/directory.
			a.	For example, if the directory created in step 3 was named 'New Hires', the Photos
				directory should be located in '..\New Hires\Photos'

Steps:

	1. Open command prompt
	2. Install modules listed in requirements.txt under 'Required Modules' with pip ( ask the tech gurus ).
		a.	Some of the modules must be manually installed ( those modules and their download links are located in requirements.txt )

Reminders:

	1.	In each excel file, the excel sheets should be left at the default name (e.g Sheet name -> Sheet1)
	2.	Require employees sending photos to name the pictures in the format LastName, FirstName or FirstName LastName
		a. Example: 
			- Last, First.png
			- First Last.jpg

			* No extra characters should be used.

Terminology:

	- directory = folder

- This process, all together, should take at most 10 minutes, far less time consuming.
