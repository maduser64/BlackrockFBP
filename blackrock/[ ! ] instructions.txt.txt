Instructions:

	This program runs on many assumptions of which will be listed below.
	All assumptions made within this program are based upon files given during
	the formation of this program and necessary information to compile.

	# 1 - Ensure that the photos being sent in are in the format (last, first) with
			no additional text. Only their last names, a comma and their first names. 
			The names must be in last, first format or errors will occur.

				- Make sure those sending in security pictures are aware of this and
					should name the image in this format. The extention doesn't matter
					as long as it is a valid image.

	# 2 - The names in the global roster for both the questions and non-questions excel
			files must be accurate and spelled exactly as the names on the photos
			provided. Every single character in the first name in the excel must correspond 
			with the characters in the first name in the photo and same for the last name.

					- To further understand what I mean, what the program does is it looks
						through the given excel sheet, collects the names in the file and stores
						it. It then looks through the file with the photos and matches the photos
						with the saved names by looking at the last name and first name. So any
						errors in the name will lead to the program matching the names with no
						picture.

	# 3 - Both excel sheets (question and non-question excel shets) must be within the same
			directory ( directory = folder). Make sure you create move both excel sheets into its 
			own directory. Then record the path of the directory (example: 'C:\users\desktop\').
			ALSO make sure there are ONLY 2 excel files within the directory. Putting only 1 of the
			required files will lead to an error.



Note: After program has completed its processing, double check to ensure no pictures are missing.
